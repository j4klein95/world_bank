# World Bank Work

##Description:
* This is a working repository to host data analysis work I am doing on the data I gather using both the World Bank API and the World Bank Databank.

* This is more of a personal project than anything else. I have a degree in International Affairs from GW, and the World Bank Databank affords me opportunities to cross my academic interests with my data analysis skills.

* I have no set schedule to update this repo. I will add elements I work on in my free time.

##Plans:
* New ideas come to me every so often so nothing is set in stone. However, I do have some things I want to do such as:
  1. Create a bokeh server/app
  2. Do some individual country analysis and visualiztion.
  3. Create more terminal/command line apps. Then move these apps else where.
  4. Refine what I have already written.

## Currently available:

* Right now, all I have is the world_bank_script.py that you can use in the terminal.
Just type in the name of the country and the script will return net official development assistance received (Current US$). I will update as I have time.

* Some cleaned csv's and preliminary data analysis.
