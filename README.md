# World Bank Script

* This is the file where I am keeping work that I do using world bank data.

* Right now, all I have is the world_bank_script.py that you can use in the terminal.
Just type in the name of the country and the script will return net official development assistance received (Current US$).

* I plan on doing some work in the future whenever I have time. You'll see this work here.
